# Solutions-to-Online-Judge-problems
This repository contains solutions to almost all problems I have solved on SPOJ.
They're intended as a last resort in case you've tried very hard to solve a problem but you just haven't been able to figure it out. 

For a few problems I have multiple solutions, usually because after my first successful submission I discovered there was a much better way to solve the problem.
